I would babysit at least once a week (usually more) during the week while I was in middle and high school for families in my neighborhood. The ages ranged from infants to 14 year olds throughout my time living at home. Most summers I would nanny for the family next door (a boy and a girl 5 and 7 until they were 9 and 11). I cook, clean, play games, do crafts, and help with homework. This past school year I babysat an 6 month old. I learned a lot about infants and would say I am quite knowledgable in that area as well now. I really love children and love babysitting! I enjoy spending time with kids and helping them learn.

I am passionate about music, children and fusing those two loves together with education. I am a positive, bright, quick learning vibrant person who always puts 100% into any task given to me. I love kids! I have had extensive babysitting and nannying experience with children of all ages, including new borns for over 6 years and overseas as a live in nanny. I have also tutored English and Music for a number of years, so I am able to help with homework after school.

I cook, clean, and do errands but expect the same respect I will always give you. I have my full international and Michigan driving licenses but no car, so something that is a bus ride or walkable (15-20 minutes) would be ideal. I live in the historic district on central campus but also spend a lot of time on North Campus as music student.

Born and raised in Queens, NY, to a mother who was primarily a babysitter for a living. I often went along with my mother to her workplace, being a private home, where she was a full time nanny. For over a decade, I would occasionally help with the children my mom babysat; and she had worked for three different families during that time period. As a result, I was exposed to caring for children of a variety of ages and personalities. In high school, I took on my first job, as a tutor of math and English to elementary and middle school aged children, working for the NYC board of education. I also tutored for a family in my neighborhood. In this way, I began acquiring teaching skills, in addition to my child care skills. In addition, as a high school\/college\/and now graduate student, I have spent many hours in the classroom and at various unique outreach events where I was either entirely in charge of the class and\/or assisting students one-on-one with a project. While pursuing my undergraduate degree at Columbia University, I was the charter co-president of Circle K, a volunteer organization which matched me with many of these outreach opportunities. My commitment to giving back through education based outreach continues now in graduate school where I am the outreach co-chair for the Society of Women Engineers. This allows me to plan and execute weekly hands-on engineering based activities with a class of 4th to 6th grade students at Adams STEM Academy in Ypsilanti, among other activities.

During my four years at U of M, I had served as a camp counselor for Camp Kesem, a summer camp for kids whose parents have cancer. This week is intended for a week of pure fun for the kids, allowing them to escape from the daily worries of having a parent with cancer. I do this solely because I want to make sure the kids have a great time and enjoy themselves. I have a great passion for working with kids and aspire to become a pediatrician. I will be graduating from U of M soon, but will be taking a gap year to prepare myself for applying to medical school. I will have lots of free time to be able to nanny, babysit, or pet sit. I also have my own car here in Ann Arbor so transportation won't be an issue. I also have lots of crafts, books, and games that I can bring with me for the kids to play with.
